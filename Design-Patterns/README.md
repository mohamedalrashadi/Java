## üèóÔ∏è Creational Patterns
**Focus:** Object creation mechanisms

### Patterns to Master:

#### 1. Singleton Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Ensure only one instance exists

**Use Cases:**
- Database connections
- Logger classes
- Configuration managers

**Implementation:**
```java
- Eager initialization
- Lazy initialization
- Thread-safe singleton
- Bill Pugh singleton
```

**When to Use:** Global point of access needed

---

**Use Cases:**
- Shape factory (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle)
- Vehicle factory
- Document creators

**When to Use:** Object creation logic is complex

---

---

## üèõÔ∏è Structural Patterns
**Focus:** Object composition and relationships

### Patterns to Master:

---

#### 2. Decorator Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- Remote proxy (network objects)

**When to Use:** Control object access

---

#### 4. Facade Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Simplified interface to complex subsystem

**Use Cases:**
- Library wrappers

**When to Use:** Hide complexity

---

#### 5. Bridge Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Purpose:** Notify multiple objects of changes

**Use Cases:**
- Event listeners
- MVC architecture
- Newsletter subscriptions
- Stock price notifications

**When to Use:** One-to-many dependency

---

#### 2. Strategy Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Select algorithm at runtime

**Use Cases:**
- Payment methods
- Sorting algorithms
- Compression algorithms

**When to Use:** Multiple algorithms for same task

---

#### 3. Command Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Encapsulate requests as objects

**Use Cases:**
- Undo/Redo functionality

- Remote control

**When to Use:** Parameterize operations

---

#### 4. Iterator Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Access elements sequentially

**Use Cases:**
- Collections in Java
- Database result sets
- Custom collections

**When to Use:** Traverse collections uniformly

---

#### 5. State Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Change behavior based on state

**Use Cases:**
- Vending machine
- TCP connection
- Order processing

**When to Use:** Object behavior changes with state

---

#### 6. Template Method Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Define skeleton, subclasses fill details

**Use Cases:**
- Game template
- Data parsing
- Framework hooks

**When to Use:** Common algorithm structure

---

#### 7. Chain of Responsibility ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Pass request along chain of handlers

**Use Cases:**
- Exception handling
- Event bubbling
- Approval workflows

**When to Use:** Multiple handlers possible

---

#### 8. Mediator Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Reduce coupling between objects

**Use Cases:**
- Chat room
- Air traffic control
- GUI dialogs

**When to Use:** Complex communications

---

#### 9. Memento Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Save and restore object state

**Use Cases:**
- Undo functionality
- Save game state
- Transaction rollback

**When to Use:** Need state snapshots

---

#### 10. Visitor Pattern ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Purpose:** Add operations without modifying classes

**Use Cases:**
- Compiler operations
- Document export
- Shopping cart calculations

**When to Use:** Operations on object structure

## üìö SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Rule:** A class should have only one reason to change
- Each class does one thing well
- Easier to maintain and test

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Rule:** Open for extension, closed for modification
- Add new features without changing existing code
- Use inheritance and interfaces

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Rule:** Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- Derived classes must not break behavior
- Maintain inheritance contracts

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Rule:** Don't force clients to depend on unused methods
- Many specific interfaces better than one general
- Clients use only what they need

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Rule:** Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level
- Use interfaces and abstract classes
