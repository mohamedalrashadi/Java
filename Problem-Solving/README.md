## 🎯 Problem-Solving Strategy

### Before Solving:
1. **Read carefully** - Understand the problem
2. **Clarify constraints** - Edge cases, limits
3. **Think of examples** - Test cases
4. **Identify pattern** - What type of problem?
5. **Plan approach** - Brute force → Optimized

### While Solving:
1. **Start with brute force** - Get something working
2. **Optimize** - Better time/space complexity
3. **Code cleanly** - Readable variable names
4. **Add comments** - Explain your thinking
5. **Test thoroughly** - Edge cases

### After Solving:
1. **Analyze complexity** - Time and space
2. **Review solutions** - Learn from others
3. **Note patterns** - Similar problems
4. **Document learnings** - What did you learn?
