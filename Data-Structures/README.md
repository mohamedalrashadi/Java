- HashMap from scratch
- HashSet implementation
- Load factor and rehashing
- Common hashing problems

**Time Complexity:** O(1) average case

## 🎯 Learning Strategy

1. **Understand the concept** - Why this DS exists
2. **Implement from scratch** - Don't just use built-in
3. **Analyze complexity** - Time and space
4. **Solve problems** - Apply to real scenarios
5. **Compare alternatives** - When to use which DS
